# graph-feature-extractor
This repository is a course project on [Machine Learning course](http://files.skoltech.ru/data/edu/syllabuses/2018/MA06018.pdf) at [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/). 


The project is a replication of [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519317305040)

## Short description
Graph can be seen as a subset of the more general object named simplicial complex, which consists of elements of higher-orders (i.e. triangles, tetrahedras, etc.), in addition to nodes and edges. Practically, this allows to encode higher-order interactions, while graphs only encode pairwise ones. Concept of node centrality of graphs can be generalized to higher-order elements of simplical complexes. As a result, one could extract additional higher-order local information from a simplicial complex model compared to graph one. Project requires basic knowledge of graph theory and algorithms on graphs.
